# Welcome to my Home Assistant configuration!
#
# Don't be scared by the size of my configuration file...
# It is probably the smallest you've ever seen.
#
# My system is very modular and very differently structured
# compared to other configurations you'll find online.
#
# Basically, each file in the repository does 1 (one, uno, eins)
# thing only! Click through it, you'll get it pretty fast.
#
# The configuration.yaml is only used to bootstrap the system.
